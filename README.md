### About me

I've been working as an independent Software Engineer with different Companies from all over the world for the last decade. During this time I've been providing incredible  value to my Clients through:
- Plan and implement the architecture of web platforms, REST APIs and CLI tools 
- Develop  API integrations with other platforms and web services
- Maintain and refactor existing code to make it more reliable, secure, and efficient

I was responsible for developing and implementation of a range of PHP and Symfony basedÂ business projects,  services, tools and systems that has beening used by millions of  customers. Looking back at it now I proud to be a part of engineering teams who delivered you these products: 
- Design Bundles
- Simplenight
- Snapcart
- Nova Poshta

I'm highly skilled, open minded, positive and supportive. Always focused on delivering value, but maintaining a healthy work-life balance.  I write code others can read. I'm respectful to others and judge no one. My feedback are constructive, helpful and presented tactfully. I never stops learning.

I write code with bugs, but I write tests to catch this bugs before they get to production. I make mistakes from time to time, and find growth in those mistakes. I willing to admit when I'm wrong, and isn't afraid to say "I don't know". I hate writing documentation, but do it anyway.

Now I'm looking forward to taking my career to the next level with Design Bundles Ltd. and  continue to add more value by  making an impact in the area of development and maintaining back-end parts on the web applications. 

And contribute to Open Source if my schedule will allow it. Open Source is one of the best things that Internet brought to us.

Do you wanna know a secret? Red. Always paint your code red. C'se da red runz fasta!
